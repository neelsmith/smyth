This directory hosts a a morphological data set that can be used to build a Greek morphological parser with the `kanónes` system (see <https://neelsmith.github.io/kanones/>).

`kanónes` builds parsers in specified orthographies, for specific corpora of Greek: as small or as large a corpus as you like.  This repository treats the paradigms of Smyth's grammar as a small corpus.  It therefore has a very small lexicon of stems, but a very full suite of inflectional rules.

## Status

Initial work in progress: no published releases yet.
