---

A digital edition of Smyth's *Greek Grammar for Colleges* (1920), derived from the [Perseus project's XML edition](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0007).

## Goals of this digital edition

- citation scheme following Smyth's logical outline of Chapter/Section/Subsection, etc. with all numbered Smyth paragraphs wrapped in citable TEI `div` elements
- develop an ordered CITE collection of Smyth paragraphs, indexed to hierarchical URNs of the text, to support either hierarchical text citation, or flat reference to numbered Smyth section
- all Greek in polytonic Greek range of Unicode
